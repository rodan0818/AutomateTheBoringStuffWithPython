#Comparison operators are those operators which are used to compare between the variables , values , expressions and many more
#The Comparison Operators are:

#1.Equivalent Operator (==)
"""
->This operator is already discussed in booleanDataTypes.py file but ,In short this operator helps to compare between values and variables
  to check either they are equal and identical or not and returns True Bool data Type if they are equal and identical and returns False if 
  they are not.
  Note: '==' is comparison operator and '=' is assignment operator
  For Example:
"""
#Example can be considered from the booleanDataTypes.py file


#2.Not Equal to Operator (!=)
"""
->This operator helps to check if two values or varibles are not equal and identical.If two values are not equal and identical then it
  return True and return False if they are equal and indentical which is exactly the opposite work of the Equivalent Operator.
  For Example:
"""
#In 42!=43 42 is not equal to 43 so it return True Boolean Data Type
print('The boolean data type for 42!=43 is ',42!=43)

#In 42!=42 42 is equal to 42 so it return False Boolean Data Type
print('The boolean data type for 42!=42 is ',42!=42)


#3.Less than operator (<)
"""
->This operator checks if the left side value or variable is less than the right side value or variable or not
  For Example:
"""
#Since 42 is less than 43 so it return True Boolean value
print('The boolean data type for 42<43 is ',42<43)
#Since 43 is not less than 42 so it return False Boolean value
print('The boolean data type for 43<42 is ',43<42)


#4.Greater than operator (>)
"""
->This operator checks if the left side value or variable is Greater than the right side value or variable or not
  For Example:
"""
#Since 43 is Greater than 42 so it return True Boolean value
print('The boolean data type for 43>42 is ',43>42)
#Since 42 is not Greater than 43 so it return False Boolean value
print('The boolean data type for 42>43 is ',42>43)

#5.Less than or equal to operator (<=)
"""
->This operator checks if the left side value or variable is less than or equal to the right side value or variable or not.
  Basically for True Boolean Data type either the left side value or variable should be equal to right side or left side value should be
  less than right side value
  For Example:
"""
#Since 42 is less than 43 so it return True Boolean value
print('The boolean data type for 42<=43 is ',42<=43)
#Since 43 is not less than 42 so it return False Boolean value
print('The boolean data type for 43<=42 is ',43<42)
#Since 42 is equal to 42 so it return True Boolean value
print('The boolean data type for 42<=42 is ',42<=42)


#5.Greater than or equal to operator (>=)
"""
->It can be similarly explained as the Less than or equal to operator only difference is for True Boolean Data type either the left side 
  value or variable should be equal to right side or left side value should be Greater than right side value
