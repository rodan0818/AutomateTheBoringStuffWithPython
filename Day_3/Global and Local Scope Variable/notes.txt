- A scope can be thought of as an area of source code , and as a container of variables
- The global scope is code outside of all functions.Variables assigned here are global variables.
- Each function's code is in its own local scope.Variable assigned here are local variables.
- Code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.
- Code in a function's local scope cannot use variables in any other function's local scope.
- If there's an assignment statement(eg: a =2) for a variable in a function , then that is a local variable
